# Score Prediction 
I used a T20 international dataset in which I build Machine Learning models like Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge from which I chose the model with the least Mean Absolute Error and on that model. I predicted the score by giving some of my inputs and according to that inputs it will show how much the team will score in the remaining overs and also the predicted range in which the first innings score will lie.
I downloaded the dataset from the [cricsheet website](https://cricsheet.org/downloads/t20s_csv2.zip)
